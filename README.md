# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

I have implemented training of the Agent for Deep Q-Network (DQN) and its successor Double DQN on the game of Breakout using the OpenAI Gym. Additionally, I have implemented a DQN agent that uses LSTM to encode previous observations rather than past frames as history.
